üìù Project Summary: Calorie Counter
This Calorie Counter is a simple JavaScript project that helps users track their daily calorie intake and expenditure. Users can input the number of calories consumed from snacks and meals, as well as calories burned through physical activity. Based on this data, the app calculates whether the user is in a caloric surplus, deficit, or at maintenance.

Key features include:

Dynamic form inputs for different calorie categories

Real-time validation for invalid input

User feedback with color-coded output (surplus/deficit)

Ability to reset the form with a clear button

Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and basic dynamic HTML rendering.
